# SHOPLIFT-FEATURES-IMPLEMENTATION-OCT---2022-

## Intro
NCR SelfServ-CheckOut (SSCO) Machine allows Customer to complete it's shopping without Store Supervisors involvement.This helps things done quickly, faster and automated kind of ways.

## Problem Statement
Everseen is a third party tool which detect shoplift.Customer will be using Everseen to detect shoplift, so they already made Everseen compatible with SCO, and now they want to modify some texts, need to add some additional fields while sending outbound message back to Everseen, & also want to ignore some intervention coming in wrong screens to know Everseen is not behaving correctly.

## My Role
1. Design and write the code by myself for all requirements.
2. Ownership of all features and future issues related to these requirements.
3. To assist the team in reaching project goals
4. Able to find impacted areas with mine code changes

## My Contributions
1. Minimal Code changes to make this feature working and without disturbing base flow much.
2. Most of the requirements code changes should be Configurable
3. Resolving bugs which came due to some conflicts with new flow and already working one.
4. Guided QA about the bottleneck areas so testing can be improved for those scenarios.
5. In same time frame also resolved issues which were not taken care by other devs during previous development.

## Timeline
These requirements got implemented within 25 days and extra 5 days to solve future bugs came during testing.

## Outcome
Implemented correctly within the time committed to Customer and good appreciation from Customer and my teammates since there were complexities since I need to fix previous bugs as well which were not by other dev in previous development plus we are handling thing which are located to server(Everseen).
